AECC Global assisted me from getting a letter of offer for my education, acquiring a student insurance coverage for my stay, and finally arranging my visa.`,

    text: `AECC Global Indonesia has definitely been helping a lot with my children's application process to study abroad. The counselor, Ms Yenny is very friendly and helpful in aiding my kids throughout all the necessary steps for their journey to study in Australia. I really recommended other people to get support from AECC Global Indonesia since it is more effective than doing everything on your own.`,
